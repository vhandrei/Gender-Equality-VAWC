                            MANILA, Philippines—The celebration of National Women’s Month in the month of March in the Philippines was shaken by a high-profile case of violence against women involving two celebrities—actress Ana Jalandoni and actor Kit Thompson. <br><br>

                            The Philippines has been observing National Women’s Month as a way to celebrate, empower and defend the rights of women. <br><br>

                            The high-profile case of Jalandoni and Thompson highlighted the importance of awareness about women’s rights and also the reality that there’s still a long way to go before people unlearn and end the act of justifying violence against women (VAW). <br><br>

                            Last March 18, police in Tagaytay City confirmed they had rescued Jalandoni, whose photo of herself with bruises and wounds spread on social media, as she asked for help from friends after she said she had been beaten up and detained by actor Kit Thompson. <br><br>

                            Jalandoni’s friends and staff of the hotel, where the pair was staying, had alerted authorities.
    
                            <br><br>
                            Jalandoni was taken to the emergency room while Thompson was taken to a police station for questioning on the same day. On May 19, police filed a complaint against Thompson for violation of Republic Act No. 9262, or the Anti-Violence against Women and Children Act.
